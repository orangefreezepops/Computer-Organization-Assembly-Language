I used macros for printing strings, integers and checking the HP of the user and the goblins, skeletons and the wizard. I also had two for randomizing attack power and just finding plain random integers. I didn’t find any bugs in my code. Everything worked fine for me. Most of the program was simple loops with counters, very straight forward. Also, I marked up the entire file with comments to keep myself sane and help the grader out. I explain almost all of my procedures.
